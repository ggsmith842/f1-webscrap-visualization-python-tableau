# F1 70th anniversary overview
A visual overview of Formula 1 Racing from 1950 to 2020

## Background

Formula 1 racing is a high-speed, adrenaline fueled sport that has enjoyed large popularity in Europe and increased popularity in the U.S. (include stats showing trends in growing markets//include a graph). Additionally, Formula 1 is capable of rivaling popular sports in terms of valuation. In 2016 F1 was purchases for $4.4 billion placing it at a higher valuation that the NHL (3.7) and just below the NBA (4.8). Moreso, F1 earns more revenue per match than any other sporting event, including the NFL. In terms of revenue generated, as of 2015 F1 generated $16.2 billion surpassing FIFA (forbes).

While more predominant in Europe, F1's recent purchase in 2016 by American owned Liberty Media has the potential to see an increase in support for the growing U.S. market.
