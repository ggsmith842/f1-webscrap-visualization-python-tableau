# F1 70th anniversary overview
A visual overview of Formula 1 Racing from 1950 to 2020

## Topic

Formula 1 racing is a high-speed, adrenaline fueled sport that has enjoyed large popularity in Europe and increased popularity in the U.S. (include stats showing trends in growing markets//include a graph). Additionally, Formula 1 is capable of rivaling popular sports in terms of valuation. In 2016 F1 was purchases for $4.4 billion placing it at a higher valuation that the NHL (3.7) and just below the NBA (4.8). Moreso, F1 earns more revenue per match than any other sporting event, including the NFL. In terms of revenue generated, as of 2015 F1 generated $16.2 billion surpassing FIFA (forbes).

## Process

This project was meant as a way for me to familiarize myself more with Tableau to visualize data and as an opportunity to learn more about webscraping in python.
Additionally I used MySql to create tables from the python created dataframes. Tableau allows for connection to MySql so it was fun to play around with the data in different languages and platforms. The sql file is included in the repo and contains useful examples of how to insert a csv file into MySql for future use.

For the Tableau visualizations I ended up using csv files either written from the data I collected or data I obtained from kaggle (see ref). I have also included the python code I used to scrap the necessary data and a markdown file contains a more reader-friendly way to understand the code.
